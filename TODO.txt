# URLs

The file URLS.txt contains a list of all external URLs linked in the
document. Two issues relating to these links need to be addressed.

1. The list should be checked against the document, and those URLs
   that appear in citation examples should be set in a quash-list
   for special formatting. Whether that will be plain-text rendering
   or a "phantom" link to the content is TBD pending a query to
   Jennifer Romig as editor.

2. The links need to be checked for currency. Some are broken,
   or offer only restricted access.
