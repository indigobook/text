      <h2><b>B. CASES</b></h2>

      <p><b><span class="small-caps">Indigo Inkling</span></b></p>

      <p>The format of traditional case citations
        derives from the historical print publication of bound reporters, such as
        West’s National Reporter System. The citation elements are based on the
        reporter’s volume number, title of the reporter including series number, and
        first page of the cited case. In June 2021, the famous reporter of federal
        appellate cases, the Federal Reporter, 3d published its last volume, turning
        over to the first volume of a new series, the Federal Reporter, 4th. Citations
        for federal appellate cases decided in the latter half of 2021 and beyond will
        be assigned citations along the lines of 123 F.4th 456. The Federal Reporter,
        3d is a set of books for sale by West Publishing, and Federal Reporter, 4th no
        doubt will be as well. Most researchers do not lay their hands on these books
        much less purchase them, but the elements of a traditional case citation derive
        directly from the West publication system.</p>



      <p>Starting in the early 1990s, some states began
        adopting public-domain citations, also known as neutral citations,
        vendor-neutral citations, medium-neutral citations, and universal citations,
        because they do not rely on specific proprietary bound publications. A
        medium-neutral citation looks something like this: These states are shown in Table
        T3. The Indigo Book encourages the use of public domain citations. When
        giving a public domain citation, also include a parallel citation to the
        appropriate print reporter if possible. For example: <i>Curlee by and through
          Becerra v. Johnson</i>, 2021-NCSC-32, 856 S.E.2d 478. </p>

      <blockquote>R11.1<span class="wide-space">   </span>Elements of a Full Citation.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>When providing a full citation to a case, you should generally include
        the following, with the court and year enclosed within a single set of
        parentheses:</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Italicized case name followed by an
        unitalicized comma</blockquote>

      <blockquote>volume number, reporter, first page of the case
        in the reporter</blockquote>

      <blockquote>comma, space, and pincite to an exact page</blockquote>

      <blockquote>abbreviated court name (if not precisely
        apparent from the name of the reporter) </blockquote>

      <blockquote>year</blockquote>

      <p>Case citations may also
        include the additional components such as a signal, subsequent history,
        parallel citations, and explanatory parentheticals. These additional components
        are sometimes required and sometimes discretionary, as determined by the case’s
        characteristics, the way the citation is supporting the text, or applicable
        court rules or other audience expectations.</p>

      <p>R11.1.1 <span class="wide-space">           </span>Parallel
        Citation</p>



      <p>A case citation may also
        include parallel citation to another print reporter or online location for the
        case, such as a medium-neutral citation. When the print reporter unambiguously
        indicates the identity of the court, omit the court from duplication at the end
        of the citation. When the medium-neutral citation unambiguously indicates the
        court and year, either or both elements may be omitted from further duplication
        at the end of the citation.</p>



      <p><b>Examples:</b></p>

      <p>R11.1.2 <span class="wide-space">           </span>Parentheticals</p>



      <p>A case citation may also include one or more parentheticals after the main citation elements. Parentheticals,
        if any, ordered according to the following functions: (indicating the weight of
        authority such as en banc) (indicating the source of a quotation or cited
        assertion in the main assertion being supported) (indicating explanatory
        information), if required or permitted as shown in Rule R10.</p>

      <blockquote>11.3<span class="wide-space">      </span>Comprehensive Case-Name
        Abbreviations in Citation Sentences and Clauses</blockquote>

      <blockquote>In citation sentences and clauses, abbreviate common words in case names
        according to Table

      <p>When referring to a case with an individual’s

      <blockquote>R11.5.3<span class="wide-space">            </span>Commonly

      <p>Abbreviate commonly recognized agencies and
        organizations by their initials, such as the SEC and the ACLU.</p>

      <blockquote><i>Red Lion Broad. Co. v. FCC</i>, 395 U.S. 367 (1969).
        <b>Incorrect Examples:</b> 
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote><i>Red Lion Broad. Co. v. Federal Commc’ns
          Commission</i></blockquote>

      <blockquote><i>Red Lion Broad. Co. v. Federal
          Communications Commission</i></blockquote>



      <p><b>Indigo Inkling</b></p>

      <p>Legal citation allows—and indeed
        requires—abbreviation of commonly recognized organizations, such as the acronym
        NASA for the National Aeronautical and Space Administration. But what, exactly,
        meets the standard for being commonly recognized? One useful test is to look at
        recent, credible journalism as a gauge of what is commonly known. For example,
        the New York Times abbreviates Environmental Protection Agency as EPA but does
        not abbreviate Fish and Wildlife Services as FWS. Another way to check whether
        an acronym is commonly known in a legal setting is to check the case name in a
        handful of recent cases. For example, PETA and the USDA are used in case names,
        suggesting that they <i>are</i> commonly recognized, at least for
        legal-citation purposes.<span class="wide-space">   </span></p>



      <p>But keep in mind the scolding
        Judge Silberman issued in a case before the United States Court of Appeals for
        the District of Columbia Circuit: “The use of obscure acronyms, sometimes those
        made up for a particular case, is an aggravating development of the last twenty
        years.” <i>Delaware Riverkeeper Network v. FERC</i>, 753 F.3d 1304, 1321 (D.C.
        Cir. 2014) (Silberman, J., concurring). With this judge’s aggravation in mind,
        use only those abbreviations and acronyms that are easy to understand and make
        the reader’s work easier.<span class="wide-space">   </span></p>





      <p>R11.5.4<span class="wide-space">            </span>Abbreviations
        of place names</p>

      <p>In general, abbreviate the names of countries,
        states, and other geographical places according to Table T12. Do not
        abbreviate a geographical place if it is one of the parties in the case. Do not
        abbreviate a geographical place if it is part of a citation that appears in a
        textual sentence.</p>

      <p>There are multiple ways to incorporate a
        case citation in the text of an article, brief, or other written work. In the
        example below, the case name is stated in the text and the rest of the citation
        is included as a separate sentence. </p>



      <ul>
        <li>In <i>McDonnell
            Douglas Corp. v. Green</i>, the Supreme Court held that in a disparate
          treatment case, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing
          a prima facie case of employment discrimination. 411 U.S.
          792 (1973)</li>
      </ul>



      <p>Alternatively, one can include the entire
        citation in-text as follows:</p>



      <ul>
        <li>In <i>McDonnell

      <blockquote>Reporters are
        listed by jurisdiction, and in preferred order in Table T1 (federal cases) and Table T3 (state cases). Most reporters are
        organized in sets of volumes comprising distinct series. Indicate the applicable
        series carefully because cases found in F.2d are decades if not a century
        earlier than cases found in F.4th.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>United States
        Supreme Court cases are printed in the official United States Reports, cited as
        __ U.S. __. The publication of the United States Reports is significantly
        delayed from opinions’ decision date. When there is no U.S. citation available,
        use the Supreme Court Reports (abbreviated S. Ct.).</blockquote>

      <blockquote>For state cases, choose
        the reporter listed in Table T3 for state cases whenever available. The
        standard national citation practice is to cite to the West National Reporter
        System even though most states have a state-specific official reporter or
        official medium-neutral citation system. Local customs and court rules vary
        from the standard national citation practice, as represented in Table T3.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Indigo Inkling</blockquote>

      <blockquote>For citations to state cases, the case reporter
        required by Rule R11.3 and Table T3 may not always be available to researchers using
        open-access legal information. For example, an internet site providing free
        access to cases may provide citation information for the official state
        reporter in that state (such as the California Reports, but not the West
        National Reporter. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>If you are attempting to conduct case research
        using free open-access sources, do your best to adhere to the dictates of Rule
        R11. Without access to a law library or premium fee-based legal research
        platform, a writer’s citations may need to use a reliable second choice, such
        as the official state reporter or the state’s official medium-neutral citation
        format. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Remember that when the reporter’s name
        unambiguously indicates the court that decided the case, the citation should
        not duplicate that information later in the citation. Likewise, when the medium-neutral
        citation unambiguously indicates the year of the decision, the citation should
        not duplicate that information later in the citation. In sum, choose the most
        authoritative reporter you can find that will allow future readers to locate
        and verify the case, that will identify the court and year, and that will
        provide precise pincites to the specific page or pages being cited. <span class="wide-space">  </span></blockquote>

      <blockquote>When submitting documents to state courts,

        courts’ local rules often require a parallel citation: i.e., a
        citation to both the official state reporter, followed by the unofficial
        regional and/or state-specific reporter. Each reporter will have different page
        numbers, so provide a pincite for each. Also, when the official reporter
        title makes the state or court name apparent, then don’t include it again
        in parentheses.</blockquote>

      <p>See Table T12 for the correct abbreviation for
        each state. State abbreviations are often combined with court abbreviations in
        case citations.<span class="wide-space">   </span>When you see a state
        abbreviation by itself in a case citation, that abbreviation designates the
        highest court in that state, whatever its name. Thus, a case citing “N.Y.”
        refers to the highest court in the state of New York—the New York Court of
        Appeals. A case citing “W. Va.” refers to the highest court in the state of
        West Virginia—the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. But “N.Y. Sup.
        Ct.” is the proper abbreviation for the New York Supreme Court—which some will
        be surprised to know is the name of the trial-level court in the state of New
        York. Refer to Table T3 or an official state-court website to confirm the name
        and level of each court; and refer to Table T9 for general court abbreviations.

      <p>State abbreviations are formatted consistently

        single capital letters are “closed up” with no space, as in N.Y. (no spaces).
        But abbreviations combining a single capital and any other abbreviation are
        not, as in W. Va. (with a space, because Va. is not a single capital letter.)</p>

      <p><b><span class="small-caps">Indigo Inkling</span></b></p>

      <p>The United States is a common law system, where
        court decisions play an important role in defining what the law is. To figure
        out the difference between good law and bad law, we have to look at the case’s
        subsequent history to make sure it was not vacated or reversed on the point
        being relied upon in a cited assertion. These types of important subsequent
        history are required by the Uniform System of Citation. On the other hand, some
        subsequent history is generally unimportant and should be omitted from the
        citation. Examples include the denial of a motion for reconsideration, or the
        denial of a petition for certiorari in a case decided more than two years ago. See
        Table T3 for some state-specific variations, and of course follow local practice
        and local court rules on subsequent history.</p>



      <p>Note that subsequent history is the history of
        that particular case in litigation. If a different case (unrelated parties but
        a similar legal issue) later overrules an older case’s holding, that case is no
        longer good law for that point—but subsequent history is not involved in the
        citation. This is but one example of how legal citation overlaps with legal
        analysis itself. If a writer is citing a case that was later overruled, the writer
        should not simply polish the citation’s mandatory subsequent history, but
        rather re-consider why to cite that “bad law” in the first place.</p>

        was decided less than two years ago (from the date the case is being used as a
        legal citation). Once two years have elapsed from the date of the case being
        cited, stop including <i>cert. denied</i> in subsequent history except if that
        denial is specifically important to the point being made with the citation.</blockquote>

        party’s street performances or his souvenirs? <i>Naked Cowboy</i>, 844 F.

      <p>The short form i<i>d</i>. can
        be used only to refer to the immediately preceding citation, and the standard
        for what is immediately preceding is strict indeed. Do not use <i>id.</i>
        simply because a full citation has been given somewhere previously in the text.
        <i>Id.</i> can follow a single citation; a string citation terminates the
        opportunity to use <i>id. </i>next. Indeed, any reference by name to an
        intervening authority, even without an actual citation, also terminates the
        opportunity to use <i>id.</i> next.
      </p>



      <p>There is one exception to this strict
        construction of when to use <i>id.</i> If the preceding citation includes a
        parenthetical citing a case within that parenthetical, that citation-within-a-citation
        does not foreclose the use of id. In that scenario, <i>id.</i> may be used to
        cite back to the immediately preceding citation to which the
        citation-within-a-citation is attached. Thus, a source cited parenthetically
        does not become the immediately preceding citation. This is structurally
        different from a string citation. Do not use <i>id. </i>after a string
        citation, even to attempt to refer to the final citation in the string.</p>
