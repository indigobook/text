      <h2><b>A. BACKGROUND RULES</b></h2>

      <h3><b>R1. Scope and Format of Standard Legal Documents</b></h3>

      <p>The
        Uniform System of Citation has split into two main branches, with somewhat
        different citation rules for each. <i>The Indigo Book</i> is a resource for
        legal citations in standard legal documents.</p>



      <h4>R1.1 <span class="wide-space">     </span>Standard Legal Documents</h4>

      <blockquote><i>The Indigo Book</i> states the rules and provides
        examples for standard legal documents. We define standard legal documents as
        documents created for practical law-related purposes such as court filings,
        legal memoranda, legal analysis, and other forms legal information that require
        or benefit from a technically precise and commonly understood citation format.
        The legal citations for standard legal documents using <i>The Indigo Book</i>
        adhere to a generally consistent national standard. </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Many
        state courts and local legal communities use citation forms that vary from this
        common standard, more so for state and local citations than for federal
        citations. Table T3 provides selective information on state variations. In
        writing a standard legal document to a local audience, consult Table T3, local
        rules, and local customs. Most importantly, provide the information needed to
        find, understand and evaluate the cited source; and ensure that citation
        formats are internally consistent within the document. When unsure if a state
        or local standard applies, use the generally consistent national standard
        expressed in the body of <i>The Indigo Book</i>.</blockquote>

      <h4>R1.2 <span class="wide-space">    </span>Academic Legal Documents </h4>

      <p>These are articles for publication
        in law reviews, generally authored by law professors and law students enrolled
        in J.D. programs. We will refer to them as “law review articles.” The Uniform
        System of Citation treats law review articles and standard legal documents
        differently, requiring different fonts and imposing additional footnote rules—although
        standard and academic citations provide the same information about legal sources.
        A short cross-reference highlighting key font differences is provided in Table
        T20. Full, formal citation for law review articles is outside the scope of <i>The
          Indigo Book</i>. </p>

      <h3><b>R2. Typeface Standards</b></h3>

      <h4>R2.1<span class="wide-space">     </span>Italicized Components of Legal Citations</h4>

      <p>In legal citations within
        standard legal documents, italicize the following components, whether placed in
        footnotes or textual sentences:</p>

      <blockquote>Case
        names—both full and short case names, and procedural phrases (e.g., <i>In
          re</i> and <i>ex parte</i>) preceding the
        case names</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Book titles</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Article titles</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Certain titles
        in legislative materials such as committee hearings</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Introductory
        signals (examples: <i>e.g.</i>, <i>see</i>,<i> cf.</i>,and <i>accord</i>)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Explanatory
        phrases that introduce subsequent case history (examples: <i>aff’d </i>or <i>cert.
          denied</i>)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Cross
        references, (examples: <i>infra, supra </i>and <i>id.</i>)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Words and phrases that introduce related
        authority (e.g., <i>reprinted in</i> and <i>available in</i>)</blockquote>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b></blockquote>

      <blockquote>The
        Supreme Court’s practice of allowing modifications after opinions’ initial
        release has at times extended beyond typographical corrections to substantive
        changes. Richard Lazarus, <i>The (Non)Finality of Supreme Court Opinions</i>, 128 Harv. L. Rev. 540, 544 (2014).</blockquote>



      <h4>R2.2<span class="wide-space">     </span>Additional Italicized Words in Textual
        Sentences</h4>

      <p>In the textual sentences of
        standard legal documents, also <i>italicize </i>the following components and
        words:</p>

      <blockquote>Publication
        titles (e.g., <i>The Onion</i>)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Words that are
        italicized in the original quotation, with no need to add the parenthetical
        (emphasis in original); and</blockquote>

      <blockquote>All words that
        would be italicized in the text (e.g., foreign words that are not
        commonly used in English language documents).</blockquote>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b></blockquote>

      <blockquote>As
        Adam Liptak reported in <i>The New York Times</i>, the Supreme Court sometimes corrects and modifies its opinions
        after their initial release. Adam Liptak, <i>Final Word on
          U.S. Law Isn’t: Supreme Court Keeps Editing</i>, N.Y. Times, May 25,
        2014, at A1, .</blockquote>



      <div class="inkling-box">
        <p class="inkling-title">Indigo Inkling

        </p>
        <p class="inkling">The typewriter was invented
          around the 1860s. The first edition of The Bluebook is from 1926.
          Typewriters of that era did not support italics or boldface. If you wanted to
          emphasize text, your sole option was to underline. Throughout The Indigo
          Book, you'll see us italicizing text rather than underlining, because that’s
          how we do it in the 21st Century. The Bluebook 21st ed. still gives
          you the option to do either.



        </p>
        <p class="inkling">We believe italics are easier to read and should be the preferred method
          if you have a choice. See Fed. R. App. P. 32(a)(6) (“Case names must be italicized
          or underlined.”). Consistent with modern word-processing capabilities, we also
          urge writers to format their quotations with “smart quotes” (shown here) that
          curl around the quoted material, rather than "dumb quotes" (shown
          here) that are the same whether opening or closing a quote. </p>
      </div>



      <h3><b>R3 <span class="wide-space">      </span>In-Text Citations</b></h3>

      <h4>R3.1<span class="wide-space">     </span>Three Options for In-Text Citations</h4>

      <blockquote>For standard legal documents, in-text citations can be
        rendered in three ways:</blockquote>

      <blockquote>a complete sentence that supports a claim
        in the immediately preceding sentence of text; </blockquote>

      <blockquote>a clause within the sentence when the
        citation relates to a particular part of a sentence, immediately following the
        claim it supports; or</blockquote>

      <blockquote>embedded within the sentence’s own
        grammatical flow.</blockquote>



      <h4>R3.2 Citation
        Sentences</h4>

      <p>Citations in standard legal
        documents often follow complete text sentences.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Examples:</b></blockquote>

      <blockquote>Under the due process requirement, there
        must be “some definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the
        person, property or transaction it seeks to tax.” <i>Miller
          Brothers Co. v. Maryland,</i> 347 U.S. 340, 344-345 (1954).</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Electronic
        signatures have the same legal effect as signatures signed with pen and ink.
        The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. §§
        7001-7006.</blockquote>



      <p>Citations following sentences
        can be single citations or, when appropriate, several sequential citations
        separated by a semicolon (known as a “string citation”). These string citations
        can utilize citation signals consistent with Rule 4 to show the relationship of
        the citation to the textual sentence.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b></blockquote>

      <blockquote>Prior
        to 2018, Supreme Court precedent had required a seller to have a physical
        presence within a state as a requirement of state taxation. <i>See</i> <i>Quill
          Corp. v. North Dakota</i>, 504 U.S. 298 (1992); <i>National Bellas
          Hess, Inc. v. Dep’t of Rev. of Ill.</i>, 386 U.S. 753
        (1967).</blockquote>



      <h4>R3.3<span class="wide-space">     </span>Citation Clauses</h4>

      <p>Some citations in standard
        legal documents are placed as citation clauses within sentences. Use citation
        clauses to cite sources and authorities that relate
        to only a section of the sentence. A citation clause directly
        follows the claim it relates to. It may include a signal to indicate the
        relationship of the cited source to the claim. </p>

      <p>Separate citation clauses from
        the text with commas. Do not add additional capital letters beyond the required
        capitalization of the sources being cited.</p>

      <p><b>Examples:</b> </p>

      <p>Federal law governs online
        privacy generally, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2523, and children’s privacy specifically,
        15 U.S.C. §§ 6501-6505.</p>

      <p>Although detailed
        regulations apply to children’s privacy online, 16 C.F.R. Part 312, significant
        gaps remain in both federal and state law. </p>

      <h4>R3.4 <span class="wide-space">    </span>Citations Embedded in Sentences</h4>

      <blockquote>Citations can be embedded into the grammatical
        structure of a textual sentence in a variety of ways. Because citations embedded in sentences are read as part of the
        sentence’s grammatical flow, the rules for abbreviating case names are
        different and more restrictive than for citation sentences and clauses.</blockquote>

      <p><b>Examples:</b></p>

      <p>Since the Court has
        eschewed the idea that a constitutional right could be grounded in “the
        practical opportunities for tax avoidance.</p>

      <p>In <i>Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck &amp;
          Co.</i>, the Court first eschewed the idea that a constitutional right could be
        grounded in “the practical opportunities for tax avoidance.” 312 U.S. 359,
        366 (1941),</p>

      <p>The Children’s Online Privacy
        Protection Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501-6505 (COPPA)
        was the first federal law specifically protecting children under the age of 13.</p>

        <p class="inkling-title">Indigo Inkling

        </p>
        <p class="inkling">Traditionally, the citations within standard legal documents have been
          integrated into the main body text. These citations may be placed directly
          after textual sentences, in citation sentences; as citation clauses within
          sentences; or textually embedded within sentences. Traditionally, law review
          articles present their citation support via extensive footnotes in a
          distinctive format with three different font styles (roman, italics, and Small
          Caps).



        </p>
        <p class="inkling">Some courts and lawyers are now producing standard legal documents using
          footnotes rather than in-text citations. Legal scholar, speaker, and advocate
          Bryan A. Garner is the best-known proponent of footnotes in standard legal
          documents, arguing that in-text citations interfere with textual flow and
          disguise bad writing. Others such as Professor Alexa Chew argue that in-text
          citations are superior because they integrate source information into the text,
          a process that can be accomplished with style and grace. The Indigo Book
          provides citation rules that can be used for either in-text or footnoted
          citations in standard legal documents.



        </p>
        <p class="inkling">In the original edition of The Indigo Book, Rule R3 advised writers
          “only use footnotes for standard legal documents when allowed by a court’s
          local rules.” This remains good advice, although we note that some writers use
          footnotes when not expressly prohibited by a court’s local rules. Rule R3 has
          been modified to fully accommodate the writer’s discretion. As with many
          discretionary choices, writers should select an approach based on the
          document’s purpose, audience, and overall context.</p>

      <h4>R4.1 <span class="wide-space">    </span>Function of Signals</h4>

      <p>A signal illustrates the
        relationship between the author’s claim and the source or sources cited
        following that assertion. The signal begins the citation sentence or clause. </p>

      <h4>R4.2 <span class="wide-space">    </span>Categories of Signals</h4>

      <h4>R4.3 <span class="wide-space">    </span>Combinations of Signals</h4>

      <p>When more than one category of
        authority is used in the same citation, they should be ordered according to
        categories of signals. As shown in the table above, the categories follow a
        logical order: supporting authority is provided before comparative and contradictory
        authority, and general background. </p>

      <p>In citation sentences, signals
        in the same category are listed within a single sentence, and each one is
        marked off by semicolons. Signals in separate categories, however, are listed
        in separate citation sentences.</p>

      <p><b><span class="wide-space">                   </span>Example:</b></p>

      <blockquote>Justice
        Scalia once noted that “the Constitution sometimes insulates the criminality of
        a few in order to protect the privacy of us all.” <i>Arizona v. Hicks</i>,
        480 U.S. 321, 329 (1987). <i>But see</i> <i>Maryland v. King</i>, 569 U.S. 435,
        462-463 (2013) (acknowledging the existence of “programmatic searches of either
        the public at large or a particular class of regulated but otherwise
        law-abiding citizens” such as motorist checkpoints).</blockquote>

      <blockquote>In citation clauses, all signals (irrespective of
        category) are listed within a single citation clause and separated by
        semicolons.</blockquote>

        <p class="inkling-title">Indigo Inkling

        </p>
        <p class="inkling">String citations are not always desirable or appropriate, especially in
          standard legal documents. Standard legal documents should prioritize the most
          important sources to cite and the most efficient manner of delivering that
          support to the reader, over an abundance of elaborate string citations. Judge Ruggero J. Aldisert of the Third
          Circuit describes string citations as “generally irritating and useless.” Alexa
          Chew, <i>Stylish Legal Citation</i>, 71 Ark. L. Rev. 823, 858 n. 214 (2019)
          (quoting Judge Aldisert in his book <i>Winning on
            Appeal: Better Briefs and Oral Arguments</i> 57 (2d ed. 2003). On the other
          hand, after a carefully crafted proposition drawn from several authorities, a
          string cite may be “the right tool for the job.” <i>Id.</i> at 859.



        </p>
        <p class="inkling">When a string citation is appropriate, the writer must decide how to
          order the authorities in the string. In relatively recent years, academic legal
          documents have followed an elaborate hierarchy, which essentially consists of
          the following: constitutions before statutes, state statutes in alphabetical
          order by state, federal cases before state cases, legislative materials before
          regulatory materials, and secondary materials after all other primary material.
          See <i>The Indigo Book </i>Rule R10 (1st ed. 2016); <i>The Bluebook: A Uniform
            System of Citation</i> Rule 1.4 (20th ed. 2015). This hierarchy often does, in
          fact, provide the most logical order; one would not cite Wikipedia before the
          United States Constitution, for example. But this hierarchy may not always fit
          the situation. The Uniform System of Citation is evolving to encompass more
          flexibility and discretion in a few pockets here and there, such as the basic
          principle that authorities cited in a string within a single signal should be
          placed in a helpful and logical order.</p>

      <p>A citation does not need an
        added signal if—</p>

      <p>—The source makes the same
        assertion as the sentence it is supporting.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>

      <blockquote>To
        impose the death penalty on an individual who is criminally insane is
        unconstitutional. <i>Ford v. Wainwright</i>, 477 U.S. 399, 410 (1986).</blockquote>

      <p>—The assertion is a direct
        quotation from the source.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>

      <blockquote>States
        are prohibited from “inflicting the penalty of death upon a prisoner who is
        insane.” <i>Ford v. Wainwright</i>, 477 U.S. 399, 410 (1986).</blockquote>

      <p>—The source is referred to in
        the assertion.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>

      <blockquote>In
        cases like <i>Roper</i>, <i>Atkins</i>, and <i>Ford</i>, the
        Supreme Court has established certain classes of individuals upon which the
        death penalty may not be imposed. <i>Roper v. Simmons</i>, 543 U.S. 551,

      <h5>R4.6.2
        <span class="wide-space">            </span><i>E.g.</i>,
      </h5>

      <p>Use <i>e.g.</i>, if the cited
        source is one of multiple sources to make the same assertion. The citation may
        include however many sources the author finds to be helpful. Note that the
        comma in the signal <i>e.g.</i>, should not be italicized.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Examples:</b> </blockquote>

      <blockquote>In
        a criminal case, the state bears the burden of proving the defendant’s guilt
        “beyond a reasonable doubt.” <i>E.g.</i>, <i>State v. Purrier</i>, 336 P.3d 574, 576 (Or. Ct. App. 2014).</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Prior
        to the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Riley v. California</i>, 573 U.S.
        373 (2014), several circuits had generally allowed the police to conduct
        warrantless searches of cell phones of individuals under arrest. <i>E.g.</i>, <i>U.S.
          v. Murphy</i>, 552 F.3d 405, 411 (4th Cir. 2009); <i>U.S. v. Finley</i>,
        477 F.3d 250, 260 (5th Cir. 2007).</blockquote>

      <p><i>E.g.</i>, may also be used following any other signal, such as <i>See</i> or
        <i>Contra</i> in which case an italicized comma should separate the two
        signals. Note: The comma <i>e.g.</i>, should NOT be italicized.
      </p>

      <h5>R4.6.3<span class="wide-space">             </span><i>Accord</i></h5>

      <p><i>Accord </i>is used when more than one source substantiates a proposition, but
        the text quotes just one of them. Use <i>accord</i> as the
        introductory signal for the non-quoted sources. Also, <i>accord</i> may
        be used as the introductory signal for indicating that the law of one
        jurisdiction is consistent with the law of another.</p>



      <blockquote><b>Examples:</b></blockquote>

      <blockquote>Colorado law
        makes it the “duty of every corporation or person who has reasonable grounds to
        believe that a crime has been committed to report promptly the suspected crime
        to law enforcement authorities.” Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-8-115 (2020); <i>accord</i>
        <i>Lunsford v. Western States Life. Ins.</i>, 919 P.2d 899, 901 (Colo. App.
        1996) (interpreting the reasonable-grounds standard as lower than the
        probable-cause standard enabling police to make a warrantless arrest).
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Under
        Colorado law, witnesses have a limited duty to report crimes. Colo. Rev. Stat.
        § 18-8-115 (2020); <i>accord</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch.
        268, § 40 (2020).</blockquote>

      <h5>R4.6.4<span class="wide-space">             </span><i>See</i></h5>

      <p><i>See</i> is used when an authority does not directly state but clearly
        supports the proposition. <i>See </i>is used instead of no signal
        when an inferential step is required to connect the proposition to the
        authority cited.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b> <span class="wide-space">     </span></blockquote>

      <blockquote>Citizens
        have less training than police on detecting crime and no authority to detain
        other individuals; thus, citizens’ duty to report crime is based on reasonable grounds
        to believe a crime has been committed, rather than the more exacting probable
        cause standard. <i>See</i> <i>Lunsford v. Western States Life. Ins.</i>, 919 P.2d 899,
        901 (Colo. App. 1996) (interpreting the reasonable-grounds standard to be less
        than the probable-cause standard enabling police to make a warrantless arrest).</blockquote>

      <h5>R4.6.5
        <span class="wide-space">            </span><i>See also</i>
      </h5>

      <p><i>See also</i> is used for additional sources that support a proposition.
        Use <i>see</i><i> also</i> when authority
        that states or clearly supports the proposition has already been cited or discussed.
        The use of a parenthetical is recommended when using <i>see also</i>.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b> <span class="wide-space">     </span></blockquote>

      <blockquote>Slayer
        statutes prevent killers from reaping rewards from committing homicide. <i>Lunsford
          v. Western States Life Ins.</i>, 908 P.2d 79, 83 (Colo. 1995); <i>see also</i> <i>Bennett
          v. Allstate Ins. Co.</i>, 722 A.2d 115, 117 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1998)
        (interpreting New Jersey’s slayer statute to mandate that “an intentional
        killer will not be permitted to benefit, directly or indirectly, from his
        wrongful act”).</blockquote>

      <h5>R4.6.6<span class="wide-space">             </span><i>Cf.</i> </h5>

      <p><i>Cf.</i> is used for supporting authority that is analogous to your
        proposition, or which is related but which requires some interpretive work to
        connect to your proposition. Always use a parenthetical with <i>cf.</i> to
        explain the logical connection required for the argument.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b>  </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Attorneys have an ethical duty of competence, but under Model
        Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1 comment 3, it is relaxed in emergency
        situations. <i>Cf. Carter v. Reese</i>, 2016-Ohio-4559, 70 N.E.3d 478 (holding
        that Good Samaritan law protects from liability anyone giving medical or
        nonmedical emergency aid, not only healthcare workers providing medical aid).</blockquote>



      <h5>R4.6.7 <span class="wide-space">             </span><i>See generally</i></h5>

      <blockquote><i>See generally</i> is used for useful background material. It is recommended
        that you use a parenthetical with <i>see generally</i> in order to explain
        the authority’s relevance to the proposition.</blockquote>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b> <span class="wide-space">     </span></blockquote>

      <blockquote>The slayer rule is a product of common law principles
        prohibiting killers from profiting their crimes. <i>See generally </i>Restatement (Third) of
        Restitution and Unjust Enrichment § 45(2) (Am. L. Inst. 2011) (“A slayer's acquisition,
        enlargement, or accelerated possession of an interest in property as a result
        of the victim's death constitutes unjust enrichment that the slayer will not be
        allowed to retain.”).</blockquote>

      <h4>R.4.7
        <span class="wide-space">   </span>Signals for Comparison
      </h4>



      <h5>R4.7.1<i>
          <span class="wide-space">             </span>Compare …<span class="wide-space">   </span>with …</i> </h5>

      <p><i>Compare … with …</i> is used when the relationship of multiple authorities will
        demonstrate or offer support for the proposition. It is highly recommended that
        each authority in the comparison be explained with a parenthetical in order to
        make the relationship and argument clear to the reader. </p>

      <p>Each portion of the <i>compare
        </i>…<span class="wide-space">   </span><i>with</i> … signal
        may contain multiple sources. Separate these sources using commas and
        italicized <i>and</i> between the penultimate and ultimate citation in the
        list. </p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>

      <blockquote>The
        20th Century saw sweeping changes in the definition and scope of the Due
        Process Clause. <i>Compare</i> <i>Lochner v. New York</i>, 198 U.S.
        45 (1905) (showing the Supreme Court’s historical interpretation of the Due
        Process Clause as solely protecting an individual’s right to contract), <i>with</i>
        <i>McDonald v. Chicago</i>, 561 U.S. 742 (2010) (incorporating the Second
        Amendment using the Due Process Clause), <i>BMW of North America, Inc. v.
          Gore</i>, 517 U.S. 559 (1996) (utilizing the Due Process Clause to reduce
        punitive damages), <i>and</i> <i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i>, 512 U.S.
        374 (1994) (limiting the zoning and ordinance powers of local governments under
        the Due Process Clause).
      </blockquote>

      <p>Insert a comma before the <i>with</i>.
        As with all citation sentences, insert a period to conclude the citation
        sentence. It is theoretically possible to conclude with a semicolon and
        continue with more signals and citations in the order listed within this rule,
        but it is probably not advisable. See our Indigo Inkling on string citations.</p>

      <h5>R4.7.2<i>
          <span class="wide-space">             </span>Cf. </i>(redux)</h5>



      <p>As shown above in Rule 4.6.6,
        the signal <i>cf.</i> can provide analogous support to the proposition in the textual
        sentence. It is a form of support for the text by comparative authority.</p>

      <p><i>Cf. </i>can also be used to provide comparative support within a string
        citation, referring to the previously cited authority.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b></blockquote>

      <blockquote>Slayer
        statutes seek to eliminate any financial incentive to commit murder by
        prohibiting insurance proceeds to the killer. Unif.
        Prob. Code § 2-803; cf. N.Y. Exec. Law § 632-a (2020) (seizing profits from
        publications by certain incarcerated felons).</blockquote>



      <h4>R4.8<span class="wide-space">    </span>Signals

      <blockquote><i>Contra</i> is used when a cited authority directly conflicts with the

        <span class="wide-space">            </span><i>But see</i>
      </h5>

      <p><i>But see</i> is used for authority that, while not directly contradicting

        <p class="inkling">Hyphens, en dashes, and em
          dashes are three separate marks with mostly separate functions in citations and
          sentences. These marks all comprise short, horizontal lines that—with the help
          of glasses and/or a magnifying glass—you will see have microscopically varying
          lengths.

        </p>
        <p class="inkling"><b>Hyphens</b> (shortest in
          length) are used for: phrasal adjectives (e.g., “laser-sharp focus,”
          “larger-than-life character,” and compound words (e.g., “daughter-in-law,”
          “over-the-counter”). Hyphens are also a feature of many statutory citation
          formats, such as Ala. Code § 27-14-24 and O.C.G.A. § 33-24-41. Preserve hyphens
          especially carefully when they are intrinsically part of a citation, such as 42
          U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Hyphens can be used for page ranges in standard legal

        </p>
        <p class="inkling"><b>En</b><b> dashes</b> (longer than hyphens, shorter

          Act), especially in academic legal documents.

        </p>
        <p class="inkling"><b>Em</b><b> dashes</b> (longest in length) are used

      <h3><b>R6<span class="wide-space">       </span>Full and Short Citations</b></h3>

      <h4><span class="wide-space">             </span></h4>

      <h4>R6.1 <span class="wide-space">    </span>Full Citations </h4>

      <p>Provide a full citation to a source the
        first time it is cited. Refer to the rules in <i>The
          Indigo Book</i> for examples of each source in full-citation form.</p>

      <h4>R6.2 <span class="wide-space">    </span>Short Citations</h4>

      <p>Legal citation provides frequent specific
        citations not just to sources as a whole, but to specific pages within sources.
        In some standard legal documents, every textual sentence is followed by a
        citation to a supporting legal source. Short-citation forms allow frequent
        citation in a less intrusive and repetitive way, since many full citation forms
        are quite long. </p>

      <h5>R6.2.1 <span class="wide-space">             </span>Short citations derived from the full
        citation</h5>

      <p>Short-form citations enable
        various sources to used throughout a passage without
        repeating the entire full citation every time. Short-form citations generally
        identify the source and pincite, using a form that
        follows from the full citation form, while not repeating every detail from the
        full citation.</p>

      <p>Every full citation has at
        least one short form that can be used later in a document after the initial
        full citation. Refer to the source-specific rules in the Indigo Book for
        short-citation form examples of each source. </p>

      <h5>R6.2.2 <span class="wide-space">            </span>Use of <i>Id.</i></h5>

      <p>Use the short form <i>Id.</i>
        (capitalized in a citation sentence after a text sentence) or <i>id.</i> (uncapitalized within a sentence as citation clause) to
        support a statement where it refers to the same exact source cited in the
        immediately preceding citation. <i>Id.</i> can
        be used for statutes, regulations, cases, and most other sources. </p>

      <p><i>Id. </i>can be used alone, to indicate the same page of the same source. It
        can be used with a new pincite to a page, section, or
        other subdivision, to indicate a different portion of the immediately preceding
        source. <i>Id.</i> can also refer to a preceding citation that is itself <i>Id.</i>
        or another short form of a citation. </p>

      <p>In general, do not use <i>id. </i>if
        it causes confusion or does not save space. For example, <i>id.</i>
        cannot be used after a string citation, even to refer to the final source
        listed in that string. Do not use <i>id.</i> to refer to appellate-record
        citations such as R. at 2. It may be used for sources with longer names in
        litigation documents, so long as the reference remains clear. </p>

      <p><i>Id.</i> can be used to refer to the immediately preceding citation in either
        in-text citations or footnotes. Each of the full and short citations in the
        examples above could be placed instead into footnotes. <i>Id.</i> is typically
        not used more than four times sequentially in footnotes.</p>



      <h5>R6.2.3 <span class="wide-space">            </span>Use of <i>supra</i> </h5>

      <p><i>Supra</i> may be used in certain circumstances, generally with secondary
        sources such as books and periodicals. <i>Supra</i> is not used with cases and
        statutes. Legislative hearings may be referred to with <i>supra.</i></p>

        </p>
        <p class="inkling">In academic legal documents using footnotes, a
          “preceding five” norm has developed wherein one may continue to use a short
          form citation as long as the full citation appears in one of the previous five
          footnotes.



        </p>
        <p class="inkling">There has been some variation in the application of
          this rule; for example, some practitioners will continue to use the short form
          throughout an entire article or brief unless they need to use “<i>id.</i>”
          repeatedly, in which event they follow the “preceding five” rule to avoid
          potential ambiguity. However, none of these conventions are absolute.
          Short-citation forms should be used in a clear, consistent, and helpful manner.</p>
      </div>



      <h3><b>R7
          Abbreviations</b></h3>

      <h4>R7.1 <span class="wide-space">    </span>Abbreviations Generally</h4>

      <p>Legal sources are often long and
        unwieldy. The tables at the back of <i>The Indigo Book</i> provide various
        resources for finding appropriate and required abbreviations. Tables T1, T2,
        and T3 provide information and abbreviations relevant to federal and state
        primary-source citations. Table T4 provides abbreviation for looseleaf services compiling cases and other legal sources
        in frequently updated topical collections. Table T5 provides legislative
        abbreviations. Tables T6, T7, and T8 provide abbreviations for international,
        treaty, and arbitration sources. Tables T9 and T10 provide abbreviations for
        specific types of U.S. courts and the titles of judges and officials.</p>

      <p>Table T11 is of particular interest to
        many law students and others grappling with cases and periodical citations. It
        provides common-word abbreviations used in case names and for institutional
        authors and periodical titles. Table T12 provides geographical abbreviations.</p>

      <p>Table T13 provides abbreviations for document
        subdivisions, and T14 provides abbreviations for explanatory phrases.</p>

      <p>Table 15 provides abbreviations for
        specific institutional names in periodical titles, and thus these abbreviations
        take precedence over any conflicting common-word abbreviations for
        institutional names from Table 12. For example, the American Bar Association is
        ABA, not Amer. Bar. Ass’n, when used as an
        institutional author.</p>

      <p>Table 16 provides abbreviations for
        publishing terms such as editor and translator. Table 17 provides abbreviations
        for the months of the year, needed such as in some periodical citations and
        cases found online rather than in reporters (thus requiring exact dates). </p>

      <p>Table 18 is new to the Second Edition of <i>The
          Indigo Book</i> and provides abbreviations for litigation documents such as
        citing an affidavit or petition for certiorari. Table 19 is also new and shows
        selective examples of how the Uniform System of Citation produces citations in
        standard and academic formats—in other words, a guide to converting the practical
        citations in <i>The Indigo Book</i> into a citation for an academic legal
        document (a law review). This Table is certainly not comprehensive but provides
        a quick view into the font differences within the two branches of the Uniform
        System of Citation. Finally, Table T20 provides selective citations to
        additional online citation guides. It is refreshing to see citation information
        becoming more freely available online, a trend that <i>The Indigo Book</i> is
        proud to be part of.</p>





      <h4>R7.2<span class="wide-space">     </span>Ordinal Abbreviations</h4>

      <p>Ordinal abbreviations, most commonly
        found in the court/year parenthetical of a case citation, do not use
        superscripts. <i>See</i> Rule R11 generally and Table T1 for the United States
        Courts of Appeals (i.e. the various federal circuit
        courts).</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b></blockquote>

      <blockquote>1st
        Dist. (not 1<sup>st</sup> Dist.)</blockquote>

      <p>Abbreviations for courts in the “second” and “third” district use ordinal style references within
        citations:</p>

      <blockquote><b>Examples:</b></blockquote>

      <blockquote>2d
        Cir. (not 2nd Cir. or 2<sup>nd</sup> Cir. or CA2)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>3d
        Cir. (not 3rd Cir. or 3<sup>rd</sup> Cir. or CA3)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>1st
        Dist. Ct. App. (not 1<sup>st</sup> Dist. Ct. App.)</blockquote>



      <h4>R7.3<span class="wide-space">     </span>Citations within Textual Sentences</h4>

      <p>Citations in textual sentences
        use different abbreviation rules to preserve readability of text, particularly
        for cases as noted in Rule R11. </p>

      <p>When referring to a court in a
        textual sentence, use a textual reference spelling out the court’s name
        consistent with common practice. (For related questions, see Rule R27 on
        capitalizing “Court” in court documents and legal memoranda.)</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b></blockquote>

      <blockquote>The
        Second Circuit has decided many fair-use cases.</blockquote>



      <h3><b>R8
          Quotations</b></h3>

      <h4><b>R8.1<span class="wide-space">   </span>General Principles
          for Quotations</b></h4>

      <h5>R8.1.1<span class="wide-space">  </span><span class="wide-space">             </span>Quotation
        marks</h5>

      <p>Quotations should be designated
        with quotation marks, except for block quotations.</p>

      <h5>R8.1.2<span class="wide-space">  </span><span class="wide-space">             </span>Grammatical
        integration of quotations into text</h5>

      <p>The quotation should flow with
        the rest of the text whether it woven into a sentence or introduced formally as
        a block quote.</p>

      <h5>R8.1.3<span class="wide-space">  </span><span class="wide-space">             </span>Punctuation
        with quotations</h5>

      <p>Punctuation that is part of the
        quoted text should appear inside the quotation marks. Commas and periods that
        are not part of the quoted text should also appear inside the quotation marks.</p>

      <h5>R8.1.4<span class="wide-space">              </span>Citation placement with regular and
        block quotations</h5>

      <p>Insert the citation sentence
        for the quoted material directly after the close of the quotation marks, for
        embedded quotations; or on the next line of regular text, flush left, after a
        block quotation.</p>



      <h4><b>R8.2 Alterations of Quotations</b></h4>

      <h5>R8.2.1 <span class="wide-space">             </span>Omission of letters </h5>

      <p>Place an empty bracket at the
        end of a common root word to indicate the change.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b></blockquote>

      <blockquote>“The
        court dismissed the claim[].”</blockquote>

      <h5>R8.2.2
        <span class="wide-space">            </span>Mistakes in the original quotation
      </h5>

      <p>To acknowledge a significant
        mistake in the original quotation, keep the problematic word or phrase and
        follow it with [sic] to indicate this to the reader.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>

      <blockquote>“The
        Copyright Office are [sic] a department of the Library of Congress.”</blockquote>

      <h5>R8.2.3<span class="wide-space">  </span><span class="wide-space">             </span>Substitution of letters or words</h5>

      <p>Any substitutions into quoted
        material should be bracketed. This includes words which might add clarity and
        context, and changes to the capitalization of letters</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>

      <blockquote>“[T]he
        [Copyright] Office is a department of the Library of Congress.”</blockquote>

      <h5>R8.2.4<span class="wide-space">  </span><span class="wide-space">             </span>Use
        of parenthetical clauses to indicate changes to quotation</h5>

      <p>Use the following phrases attached to a
        legal citation following a quotation, to indicate changes made to that
        quotation:</p>

      <blockquote>(emphasis added)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>(alteration in original)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>(citation omitted)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>(emphasis omitted)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>(internal quotation marks omitted)</blockquote>

      <blockquote>(footnote omitted)</blockquote>

      <h5>R8.2.5<span class="wide-space">  </span><span class="wide-space">             </span>Parentheticals
        to indicate quotations within quotations</h5>

      <p>When using a quotation within a
        quotation, you can either (1) attribute it to the original source with a
        parenthetical, or (2) acknowledge it by signaling that its citation has been
        omitted.</p>

      <p><span class="wide-space">                   </span><b>Examples:</b></p>

      <blockquote>Just
        as the Supreme Court has held that an official statement of the case, syllabus,
        or headnote prepared by judges “fall within the ‘work they perform in their
        capacity as judges,’ so too annotations published by legislators alongside the
        statutory text fall within the work legislators perform in their capacity as
        legislators.” <i>Georgia v. Public.Resource.org</i>, 140 S. Ct. 1498, 1509
        (2020) (quoting <i>Banks v. Manchester</i>, 128 U.S. 244, 253 (1888)).</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“Although the
        annotations are not enacted into law through bicameralism and presentment, the
        Commission's preparation of the annotations is under Georgia law an act of ‘legislative
        authority,’ and the annotations provide commentary and resources that the
        legislature has deemed relevant to understanding its laws.” <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted).</blockquote>



      <h5>R8.2.6
        <span class="wide-space">                        </span>Unnecessary parentheticals
      </h5>

      <p>The following should <i>not</i>
        be indicated in a parenthetical:</p>

      <blockquote>(Emphasis in original) </blockquote>

      <p>No parenthetical is needed for
        a quotation that was copied verbatim, including italics or underlined emphasis,
        from the original source. </p>

      <blockquote>(Citation omitted) or (Footnote omitted) </blockquote>

      <p>No parenthetical is needed for
        a citation or footnote call number that follows the end of a sentence in the quoted
        text. Citations omitted from within a quoted sentence should, however, be
        indicated parenthetically.</p>



      <div class="inkling-box">
        <p class="inkling-title">Indigo Inkling



        </p>
        <p class="inkling">Dealing with quoted material can be minutely technical, as with
          parentheticals such as (citation omitted, internal quotation marks removed, and
          second emphasis omitted). To simplify and streamline citations and replace the
          granular detail of such parentheticals, attorney Jack Metzler has proposed and
          promoted a shorter parenthetical to handle such situations: (cleaned up). The
          parenthetical (cleaned up) after a quotation and citation indicates essentially
          that the writer has adjusted the citation’s mechanics to the situation and will
          not list and elaborate on each mechanical modification, but is indicating to
          the reader that small tweaks have been made for clarity and convenience.



        </p>
        <p class="inkling">The (cleaned up) parenthetical has not become part of the Uniform System
          of Citation—yet. It has, however, actually been used in thousands of federal
          and state judicial opinions. <i>See</i> Jack Metzler, <i>Cleaning Up Citations</i>,
          18 J. App. Prac. &amp; Process 142 (2017). The (cleaned up)
          approach is not without its critics, though, who argue that transparently
          meticulous care with quotations enhances the writer’s credibility and does not
          unduly distract readers.



        </p>
        <p class="inkling">Practically speaking, the (cleaned up) parenthetical may be helpful in
          certain citation situations and with receptive audiences. What an advocate
          should do when arguing on behalf of a client is, of course, different from what
          a court can do in formally issuing its opinion deciding the case. Yet change is
          possible, through the work of citation guide authors issuing new editions and,
          more generally, through the advocacy in the citation community. The (cleaned
          up) parenthetical demonstrates that legal citation evolves and is subject to
          influence and new ideas.</p>

      <h5>R8.3.1<span class="wide-space">  </span><span class="wide-space">             </span>Ellipses
        generally</h5>

      <p>An omission is indicated by an
        ellipsis where the words are omitted:<span class="wide-space">   </span>.
        . .</p>

      <p>The ellipsis in legal writing
        is represented by three periods and four spaces. </p>

      <p>Insert a space after the last
        letter of the preceding phrase, a space between each period, and a space before
        the first letter of the following phrase. Rules R8.3.2-R8.3.7 contain rules and
        examples for incorporating ellipses in various situations.</p>



      <h5>R8.3.2<span class="wide-space">             </span>Omission from the beginning of a quoted
        sentence</h5>

      <p>When omitting the beginning of
        a quoted sentence, do not use an ellipsis. Instead, capitalize the first letter
        and place it in brackets. If the first letter of the quoted material is already
        capitalized, no change is needed, but—as with all quotes—ensure that the
        quotation is accurate in context.<span class="wide-space">   </span></p>

        provider was subjectively aware of facts that would have made the specific
        infringement <i>objectively</i> obvious to a reasonable person.”</blockquote>

      <h5>R8.3.3<span class="wide-space">             </span>Omission in the middle of a sentence</h5>

      <p>When omitting the middle of a

        a phrase or clause</h5>

      <p>If there is an omission within
        the quotation, mark the omission with an ellipsis.</p>

      <h5>R8.3.5<span class="wide-space">             </span>Omission at the end of a sentence</h5>

      <p>When omitting the end of a

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>

      <blockquote>“The
        difference between actual and red flag knowledge is thus not between specific
        and generalized knowledge . . . .”</blockquote>

      <p>When omitting material at the
        end of one sentence and the beginning of the next sentence, use one ellipsis to
        mark the omission but include the final punctuation mark of the first sentence
        as well as bracket and capitalize the first letter of the following sentence.</p>

        <p class="inkling">The ellipsis is traditionally made with four spaces and three periods .
          . . but computers have keyboard shortcuts to produce an ellipsis that
          constitutes one single character. For example, option-semicolon on an Apple
          keyboard produces … as its ellipsis shortcut.<span class="wide-space">  
</span>While the ellipsis shortcut character is not officially sanctioned in
          any citation manual, some practitioners use it freely in court filings.

        <p class="inkling">Non-substantive tweaks to citations to meet a word count appear to be a
          modest but burgeoning trend. The 21st edition of <i>The Bluebook</i> breaks
          with tradition in allowing writers to omit previously required spaces in a
          citation such as 123 F. Supp. 2d 456, turning it into 123 F.Supp.2d 456. This
          unspaced citation may look incorrect to many legal readers. But if a legal
          writer is making choices to meet a difficult word count, we submit that the
          ellipsis shortcut key may be a worthwhile tradeoff as well. </p>

      <blockquote>Georgia minimizes the OCGA annotations as non-binding and
        non-authoritative, but that description undersells their practical significance.
        Imagine a Georgia citizen interested in learning his legal rights and duties.
        If he reads the economy-class version of the Georgia Code available online, he
        will see laws requiring political candidates to pay hefty qualification fees
        (with no indigency exception), criminalizing broad categories of consensual
        sexual conduct, and exempting certain key evidence in criminal trials from
        standard evidentiary limitations—with no hint that important aspects of those
        laws have been held unconstitutional by the Georgia Supreme Court. See OCGA §§
        21-2-131, 16-6-2, 16-6-18, 16-15-9 (available at www.legis.ga.gov). Meanwhile,
        first-class readers with access to the annotations will be assured that these
        laws are, in crucial respects, unenforceable relics that the legislature has
        not bothered to narrow or repeal. See §§ 21-2-131, 16-6-2, 16-6-18, 16-15-9

      <blockquote>Block

        block quotation its appearance as a rectangular “block” of text on the page.</blockquote>

        if the entire block quotation is itself a quotation within the source being
        quoted, and indicate the quotation parenthetically after the block.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Internal quotation
        marks should appear as in the original. Format internal quotation marks as
        double quotation marks when the block quotation is not itself surrounded by
        quotation marks, as should be the norm.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>The citation following a block
        quotation should start at the line’s left margin,
        without any indentation. This citation can be a full citation or a short

        to the page or pages where the quoted material is found.</blockquote>



      <h3><b>R10
          Explanatory Parentheticals</b></h3>

      <p>Sometimes, it is helpful to
        include extra information to explain the relevance of certain citations.
        Explanatory parentheticals may consist of phrases typically started
        with a present participle such as (holding . . . ),
        direct quotations from the source, or short statements. Parentheticals
        also provide information about the weight of the authority cited, particularly
        with cases.</p>

      <h4>R10.1<span class="wide-space">   </span>Capitalization in Parentheticals</h4>

      <h5>R10.1.1<span class="wide-space">            </span>Paraphrases and other original parentheticals</h5>

      <p>If not quoting the authority,
        do not begin an explanatory parenthetical with capital letter.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>

      <blockquote><i>Dr. Seuss Enters., L.P. v. Penguin Books USA, Inc.</i>, 109 F.3d 1394 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding that publisher’s asserted parody
        of O.J. Simpson murder trial was substantially similar to copyrighted work).</blockquote>

      <h5>R10.1.2<span class="wide-space">            </span>Quotations in parentheticals</h5>

      <p>If quoting the authority, only
        begin parenthetical with capital letter and end with a period when the
        parenthetical quoted is or reads as a complete sentence.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Example:</b> </blockquote>

      <blockquote><i>See</i> <i>Ty, Inc. v. Publ’ns Int’l Ltd.</i>, 292 F.3d 512, 520 (7th Cir. 2002)
        (“[T]he shortage that creates the secondary market stampedes children into
        nagging their parents to buy them the latest Beanie Babies, lest they be
        humiliated by not possessing the Beanie Babies that their peers possess.”).</blockquote>



      <h4>R10.2<span class="wide-space">   </span>Format and Order of Parentheticals Showing the
        Weight of Authority<span class="wide-space">           </span></h4>

      <p>Some citations need to provide
        other types of parentheticals about the source itself, and these source-related
        parentheticals are given before explanatory parentheticals. </p>

      <p>Examples of source-related
        parentheticals include information about a judicial opinion’s weight of
        authority as (per curiam) or (en
        banc), information about the source as a quote such as information being
        omitted or emphasis added, information about a source being quoted within the
        source, and bracketed definitions of the source as a short-form citation, such
        as [hereinafter “Color of Creatorship”]. </p>

      <p>The source-related
        parentheticals are followed by the explanatory parenthetical, if any; and last,
        the prior or subsequent history (<i>see</i> Rule R14) as shown in this order of

      <blockquote>(date) [hereinafter &lt;short

        opinion) (per curiam) (alteration in original)
        (emphasis added) (footnote omitted) (citations omitted) (quoting &lt;another
