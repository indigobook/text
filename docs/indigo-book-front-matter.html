      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>



      <p>Welcome to <i>The Indigo
          Book 2.0</i>—a free, Creative Commons-dedicated implementation of the uniform
        system of citation commonly used in United States legal documents.</p>



      <p><i>The Indigo Book </i>(2d ed. 2021) isn’t
        the same as <i>The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation</i> (21st ed.
        2020), but it does implement the same system of citation that <i>The
          Bluebook</i> does. The scope of <i>The Indigo Book</i>’s coverage is
        roughly equivalent to <i>The Bluebook</i>’s “Bluepages”—that
        is, <i>The Indigo Book</i> covers legal citation for U.S. legal
        materials, as well as books, periodicals, and Internet and other electronic
        resources. For the materials that it covers, anyone using <i>The Indigo
          Book</i> will produce briefs, memoranda, law review articles, and other
        legal documents with citations that are compatible with the Uniform System of
        Citation. Although law students, scholars, and legal professionals sometimes
        talk about legal citation as if it is truly uniform, the fact is that legal citation
        has—in practice—never been a uniform national system. Accordingly, <i>The
          Indigo Book</i> also provides insight into some of the discretionary
        preferences and jurisdiction-specific variations found in legal citation
        throughout the United States.</p>



      <p>Unlike <i>The Bluebook </i>and
        competitor citation manual <i>The ALWD Guide to Legal Citation</i>, <i>The
          Indigo Book</i> is free, in two senses. <i>The Indigo Book</i> is
        given to you free of charge. <i>The Indigo Book</i> is also free of the
        restrictions of copyright. You are free to copy and distribute this work, and to
        improve on it. As with the 2016 version, we are releasing this version of <i>The
          Indigo Book</i> under a Creative Commons “CC0” public domain dedication
        that allows you to use it, copy it, distribute it, and modify it. <i>The Indigo
          Book</i> welcomes the Juris-M project for automating legal citations, built in
        connection with the citation formats provided here.</p>



      <p>The first edition of <i>The
          Indigo Book</i> was compiled by a team of students at the New York
        University School of Law, working under the direction of Professor Christopher
        Jon Sprigman and published in 2016. The second
        edition of <i>The Indigo Book</i> was compiled by Professor Jennifer Murphy Romig with assistance from students at the Emory University
        School of Law, and published in 2021. In the five years since the first edition
        of <i>The Indigo Book</i>, U.S. citation practices have continued to expand and
        fragment. The proliferation of citation formats has taken place via both
        official channels, such as the North Carolina Supreme Court’s adoption of
        medium-neutral citation format; and unofficial practices, such as the growing
        use of (cleaned up) as a parenthetical to replace (internal citations and
        quotation marks omitted), as promoted by Washington, D.C. lawyer Jack Metzler. </p>



      <p>This Second Edition of <i>The
          Indigo Book</i>, like the first one, continues to take its inspiration from the
        10th edition of <i>The Bluebook</i>, published in 1959:</p>



      <blockquote>The
        primary purpose of a citation is to facilitate finding and identifying the
        authority cited. The rules set forth in this booklet should not be considered
        invariable. Whenever clarity will be served, the citation form should be
        altered without hesitation; whenever a citation would not amplify the
        identification of the authority referred to, no citation should be given.</blockquote>



      <p>In that spirit, we hope you
        will take <i>The Indigo Book</i>, use it, enjoy it, and continue to improve
        it. </p>



      <p>Professor Jennifer
        Murphy Romig
        Emory University School of Law</p>
