      <p><b>Indigo Inkling </b></p>

      <p>The “et al.” option for books and law review articles with
        multiple authors may be a space-saving option, but it may also effectively
        erase the contribution of c0-authors other than the first-named. This citation
        erasure may occur qualitatively (in how the article is remembered) and/or
        quantitatively (in various empirical citation rankings). University of
        Pennsylvania Law School professor Dave Hoffman  that all authors should
        be included in the full citation, and indeed have rejected the et al.
        option. Professor Hoffman calls this approach . </p>

      <blockquote>Short-forms for books and law review articles may be based on just
        the first-named author, an approach consistent with the spirit of efficient
        short-form citations. But the Fair Citation Rule can be followed in short
        citations as well, an approach that is less efficient but more representative
        of the work.  R28.2.3<span class="wide-space">            </span>Title

      <blockquote>Include the
        exact page number you are referring to. If you are citing a work organized
        using sections or paragraphs, use those instead, adding a page number only if
        helpful. Do not use “at” before the pincite in a full citation.</blockquote>

        (i.e., URL information should not be included).</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Exact
        copy: unaltered online reproduction of the entirety of a printed source,
        including pagination.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Official
        copy: version of document designated “official” by a federal, state, or local
        government.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Authenticated
        copy: source that uses some authenticating tool, such as a digital signature.
        This is generally the preferred version.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>For
        Internet sources that have the characteristics of a print source, cite as if
        you were citing the print source, and append the URL to the end of the
        citation. Internet sources have the characteristics of a print source if the
        source has all the information needed to cite it according to another rule and
        the source has a fixed, permanent pagination (such as a PDF).</blockquote>

      <blockquote>R32.4<span class="wide-space">              </span>Webpages and Internet Sources</blockquote>

      <p><b><span class="small-caps">Indigo Inkling</span></b></p>

      <p>Note that many of the Internet
        citation rules are little more than common sense (that’s a compliment, not a
        dig). For example: include the URL that most directly links your reader to the
        authority, as you don’t want to send readers on a wild goose chase through the
        recesses of the Internet in search of a source. For the sake of completeness,
        we include these rules below, even though most people would probably intuit
        them.</p>

      <p>Citations to Internet sources

      <blockquote>When the
        name of the individual, personal author is unavailable, use the name of the
        institution associated with the source if one is clearly apparent. Institutional
        authors should be omitted if the website’s title makes the domain’s owner
        clear. Institutional authors should be abbreviated (see Table T12 and T11 for
        abbreviations). Excessively long institutional-author names may be truncated

        identification.</blockquote>

      <p>When a document is available in
        multiple formats, cite to the format that best preserves the document as it
        would display if printed. This will allow citations to specific page numbers
        (for pincites) regardless of whether it is being viewed digitally or in print.
        For example, PDF is preferred over HTML.</p>

      <p><b>R34. Short Form
          Citations for Internet Sources</b></p>

      <p>After a full citation to an
        internet source, an appropriate short form may be used. <i>Id.</i> can be used
        to refer to an internet source, consistent with Rule R6. The short form <i>supra</i>
        can be used to shorten the full citation where <i>id.</i> is not appropriate. </p>



      <p>A bracketed parenthetical also
        may also be used to provide a short-form definition, if needed to avoid
        ambiguity or to preserve clarity. When citing directly to Internet
        sources, the “hereinafter” bracketed parenthetical should come right
        after the URL or, if applicable, the “last visited”
        parenthetical.<span class="wide-space">   </span></p>
