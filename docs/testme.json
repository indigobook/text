The dispute arose from an inter-creditor agreement that was expressly referred to by the indenture and contained an English law jurisdiction clause that had a distinct effect of its own. The Court found that the English Court had jurisdiction to hear a dispute arising from a complex loan arrangement, notwithstanding that the indenture governing the terms of the debt gave jurisdiction to the courts of New York.",
