# indigo-book-converter

This is a bare-bones proof-of-concept demo of conversion from a document saved
from Word as "Web Page" to cleaner HTML, while preserving (or transforming)
selected features of the original.

To try it out, clone this repository, enter the top-level directory,
install the dependencies, and run the code to build the book as an
HTML file.

1. ``git clone https://github.com/fbennett/indigo-book-converter.git``
2. ``cd indigo-book-converter``
3. ``npm install``
4. ``node .\doitall.js``
